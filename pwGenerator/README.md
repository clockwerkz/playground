# passwordgenerator

Your application's GitHub repository should contain a README.md file explaining the purpose and functionality of the application. The README.md file should include a screenshot of the completed application as well as a link to the deployed GitHub Pages URL.


What it's about:
This password generator asks the conditions of the password (lenth, numbers, special characters, upper, and lower), then it shuffles it and spits out a password.
